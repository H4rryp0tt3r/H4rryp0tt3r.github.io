This is a simple web challenge. In this they gave a web page like below with a simple login form with POST method and a link to php source file as well.

{% include image.html url="/assets/e2b6773793bd4c07b1aab10614b1491c/chall.png" description="Login page of the given challenge" %}

And here is the source code in PHP

{% highlight php %}
<?php
include 'foo.php';
$user = $_POST['username'];
$pass = $_POST['password'];
if( !strcasecmp($user, "admin") && !strcasecmp($pass, $secret)) {
    echo"<h1>$flag</h1>";
}
else {
    echo"<h1>No flag for n00bs..</h1>";
}
?>
{% endhighlight %}

It's apparent that the program will compare a POST parameter named password against a string `$secret` using the strcasecmp() function, If the result of this comparison is 0 then flag is displayed.

Focusing on the the strcasecmp function, need to find whether there are any other ways to make output of this function to 0, besides the obvious case where the strings were equal.

After a quick trip to php.net, I got a point that "In modern php versions, the strcasecmp() function will return 0, if any of the parameters is an array".

So, I changed name of the password field to `password[]` (This makes $_POST["password"] an array)

{% include image.html url="/assets/e2b6773793bd4c07b1aab10614b1491c/web.png" description="Source inspection view" %}

And then I submitted that form with username "admin".

I got the flag: **flag{fb1186d3dfd25773d51964cf0d62d302}**
