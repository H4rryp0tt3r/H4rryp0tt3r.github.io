Heard about HeartBleed?
The Heartbleed bug allows anyone on the Internet to read the memory of the systems protected by the vulnerable versions of OpenSSL software. This compromises private keys that used to decrypt HTTPS requests. This allows attackers to eavesdrop on communications, steal data directly from the services and users and to impersonate as well.

So basically, once the attacker steals private key of the server, he will be able decrypt the intercepted traffic or any previously captured traffic.
